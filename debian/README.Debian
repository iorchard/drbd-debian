drbd for Debian
---------------

To make sure the default installation of drbd is non-interactive, I
have set the default value of the inittimeout parameter to be a
negative number.  This may not be what you would like for a production
setup.  See the drbd.conf man page and pay special attention to the
inittimeout, skip-wait, and load-only options.
